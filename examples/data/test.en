Mr President, it is always the same: for a better tomorrow, to abolish inequalities, to liberate the people from oppressors and tyrants, to end poverty and destitution, to use the country's wealth for the good of the nation - someone takes power.
It is more of an asset because of the observation of the legal structure presented, looking to clarify the institutional barriers verified in the post-Treaty of Lisbon period and trying to specify legislative solutions for any problems that are identified: 'Lisbon' requires a CSDP.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like everyone, we are all, obviously, involved in and upset by this situation, but I believe that it is a duty, at least for me, to reject any kind of hypocrisy.
I believe that, here in Parliament - and as long as the texts are not unpicked in the votes we shall be having in plenary in a few hours - we have succeeded in finding this compromise, including in the 14 proposals that emerge from the three reports as a whole.
Moreover, we all know here in Parliament, on the left and increasingly on the right, that an immigration policy which only includes repressive measures is not an immigration policy whatsoever, because an immigration policy worthy of this name also requires a legal section for legal immigration channels.
I think Parliament has constrained itself too tightly, and we should more properly reflect the interinstitutional agreement of 2001 in our procedures to permit committees to talk about substantive changes to parts of directives or regulations that the Commission is seeking to recast, but in a very restricted form.
Madam President, Commissioner, as Parliament's rapporteur for the own-initiative report on the role of women in agriculture and rural areas, it was my aim to conduct a broad public debate in order to give more visibility and weight to the important multi-functional role of women in rural areas.
The way in which humans deal with natural resources, the way in which humans destroy habitats and overexploit wild plants and animal species, the way in which humans illegally trade in wild fauna and flora, all of this represents an ongoing attack on the biodiversity of spaceship Earth.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, energy security is undoubtedly a fundamental priority that must be enhanced firstly by increasing energy efficiency and diversifying the suppliers, sources and supply routes, but above all by promoting the Union's energy interests in respect of third countries.
This model has clearly been unsustainable, resulting in the build-up of significant fiscal, which means a high general government deficit and growth debt stock, increasing interest payments and macro-economic, which implies a high current account deficit and external debt outflow of income imbalances.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission set up the Reflex mechanism for vulnerable countries about a year ago, in August 2009, earmarking EUR 500 million for the purpose of combating the impact of the global economic crisis on the more fragile African countries over the period from 2009 to 2010.
The real question for the rapporteur is whether we want to put all those positive benefits at risk by attaching to this proposal an issue about country-of-origin marking, which - as Mrs Rühle quite rightly points out - has already been proposed by the Commission on a whole range of products.
In recent weeks, the European Parliament and the entire international community have mobilised themselves in defence of Sakineh, but also in defence of all the men and women who live under the same conditions in Iran and, indeed, in every other part of the world in which fundamental rights continue to be violated.
(DE) Madam President, in competition with road freight traffic, freight traffic on the railways only stands a chance if it really is established throughout Europe, which is why I welcome the introduction of cross-border freight traffic corridors, on which freight traffic will be optimised.
Lastly, I would like to mention the progress made on the prospectus, the key investor information for consumer protection, noting that in this case as well we would have liked a hard copy of the prospectus to be circulated automatically due to its small size, and not solely on request.
I would like to emphasise that the provision of better coordination between individual levels of control, greater flexibility, and transparent and clear procedures, not only represent features of good administration of public affairs but, above all, should facilitate the drawing down of funds and increase the participation of potential partners in projects.
Nearly four and a half years after the adoption of the notorious Services Directive, known as the Bolkestein Directive, this essential issue, which covers a wide spectrum of activities accounting for around 40% of EU GDP and jobs, is once again on the European Parliament's agenda.
I visited him afterwards to say that we needed to lift the sights of this Economic Council to look at the long range strategic technological issues that we are both working on, and particularly to work around the basis of standards which my committee has been doing a lot of work on over the last few months.
My question, therefore, is how does the Presidency view this matter and how do you think the matter should be addressed by the Member States, in light of the fact that, as we all know, Cuba tabled a motion before the UN General Assembly on 28 October for the US embargo to be lifted?
I voted in favour of the joint resolution on the Goldstone report, not least because it recognises that the people of Gaza continue to live under appalling conditions as a consequence of the blockade and because it calls for an immediate, permanent and unconditional opening of the border crossings.
These agreements put an end to a dispute that, for more than 15 years, has seen Europe at odds with the Latin American banana-producing countries and the United States, which condemned the preferential treatment given by Europe to exports from the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States.
Other countries, such as the United States, Canada or a number of emerging countries that are affected by the problem of tuberculosis, whether directly, as it impacts on their populations, or indirectly in the context of international solidarity, should quite logically make their own contribution to this initiative too.
Very many Hungarian citizens and economists do not understand either why the Hungarian Government decided in this way, because Hungary is a small country with an open economy, and the argument that this would have obstructed tax competition is unsound since it is only about the harmonisation of the corporate tax base.
I worked with - to name a member of the DG - Jan on this very important principle, namely that, if you are refused a visa, or you are refused entry into the Schengen area, your appeal may not be suspensive, but the authority that refuses must make itself accountable.
If this incentive is now being removed and, at the same time, they have to accept a most favoured nation clause, coupled with the fact that the state revenue will fall as a result of the loss of revenue from duties, it is no wonder that the ACP countries were so hesitant.
It is of no help whatsoever if we merely tag a few nice words about the environment and the indigenous peoples on to the decisions we take but our actual deeds mean that we seriously risk contaminating the environment irreversibly and that we violate the rights of the indigenous population.
It is not only left-leaning economists - in its economics section yesterday, for example, Le Monde, which is not a left-leaning newspaper, made it quite clear: austerity on the one hand - yes, we need certain restrictions - but we also need growth and investment.
Moreover, many times the extra security that passengers are getting by paying extra charges is not even provided by the state, but by subcontracted private companies, often disregarding the passengers and their rights under the general shelter provided by the secrecy covering security matters in general.
I see that many people working for the authorities, with the support of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), too - my sincere thanks to the European institutions and to Commissioner Dalli for the fact that the European Union is also helping to investigate this matter - are really working very intensively on this.
We know that social exclusion and poverty are increasing, and in order to deal with this we, and the Commission too, must be able to act in a resolute way to provide financing facilities for the small and medium-sized enterprises, because that is where the jobs will be created in Europe.
The conclusions from the report debated on Wednesday in the European Parliament highlight to us that importing agricultural produce from third countries has a much greater detrimental impact on the environment than internal production, which is subject to stricter regulations on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, making it conducive to climate change.
in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report, because I believe that regional development is becoming a particularly relevant issue today, as rural areas are becoming more and more sparsely populated, due to social change and changes in social structures, values and a growing tendency towards individualisation.
While I agree that passengers have the right to get better information and help from bodies and at terminals throughout the EU, it is important not to unduly burden the small, domestic or voluntary bodies that operate in rural areas, something which would put pressure on them to cut back on the services they provide.
Finally, the measures, which, in my view, run contrary to the spirit of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, have hit the weakest countries, including Greece, Portugal and Spain, while the stronger, wealthier countries have not yet taken on their share of the burden.
Given that this proposal for an amendment to the Parliament and Council Directive 2000/75/EC complies with the Animal Health strategy (2007-2013) and points towards a more flexible approach in the vaccination system, thereby contributing to improved control of major animal diseases, I am voting in favour.
A year ago, we witnessed in Haiti one of the worst natural catastrophes in recent history, but this also triggered one of the best displays of solidarity, with people whose resilience in the face of disaster and disorder is a lesson of courage to us all.
Most of those surveyed said that the European Union is out of touch, corrupt and is poor value for money; 83% of those polled want UK law to be paramount and, therefore, to revoke the supremacy of EU law; and 71% want a referendum on continued British membership.
I firmly believe that modernisation of the Korean democratic people's army should not be a priority to which the citizens of the European Union should make financial contributions, and that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea does not yet belong to the list of countries proposed in the appendix by the Commission.
In terms of EU international trade policy in the context of climate change, even if others do not go along with us, our objective should be to focus our efforts on scientific research, technological innovation relating to non-carbon energy sources, energy efficiency and the creation of green jobs, in order to increase our competitiveness.
We have seen considerable cross-party agreement on these issues at committee stage, and I hope that a strong, clear position of the whole Parliament, together with a proper evaluation of the legal circumstances, will result in a redrafting of the proposal and the presentation of a more appropriate one to replace it.
What we need instead is democratic legitimacy, a two-chamber system which will finally put an end to the nonsense of the Council, which is outwardly so pro-European, but internally makes decisions without democratic legitimacy, so that we can bring about true democracy in Europe.
I should like to say that the European Commission is prepared to accept the compromise package, especially the point relating to the need to extend the transitional period by four years instead of three and the point relating to the two-year limitation on any further extensions, in order to facilitate the review programme.
Mr President, I would like to thank all three Members for the reports we are discussing here today in the joint debate, and I would particularly like to talk about Mrs Lichtenberger's report, as it shows exceptional rigour in my opinion, and I agree with much that it says.
In voting against the report, the Greek Communist Party voted against the CAP as a whole, both current and 'new', which has ruined small and medium-sized holdings and promotes agricultural development on the basis of the criterion of the profitability of the monopoly food companies.
I wish to emphasise the importance of direct consultations between the authorities in European Union countries in order to do away with parallel proceedings and avoid situations where the relevant institutions in a particular state have to subjectively determine sentences for charges brought against citizens, in most cases, due to a lack of information.
I addressed the question of the functional overlap between two agencies - the ETF and Cedefop - in my introductory speech, but I would like to stress again that the contribution of these agencies can be crucial, especially in the context of increasing employment in line with the 2020 objectives.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, the session went a little bit over time and the President of the Commission had to leave because of other obligations, but it is an honour for me to answer on behalf of President Barroso and on behalf of the Commission.
I also consider it essential for shareholders to participate more in and take more responsibility for ensuring that good administrators are rewarded by the market and that less ethical managers are punished, so that their practices do not harm the rights of shareholders or have a negative impact on the entire market.
Commissioner, just to finish, the great advantage to me is that I can now look to my constituents and, when they ask me what the European Union has done for them, I can say that we have made it possible for you to take your pet on holiday - your cat, your dog or your ferret.
It is also important to remember that thanks to its adoption, we will be contributing decisively to restructuring and maintaining several dozen jobs in the Azores, as well as the technical know-how linked to activity in the agro-industrial sugar sector, at a time of extremely tough economic crisis.
The maternity protection system in force in Italy is, on the whole, in line with the new parameters proposed in the directive, not only with regard to the number of weeks of compulsory maternity leave, but also with regard to the payment of 100% compensation to cover income during the period of absence.
(PL) Madam President, President-in-Office, it is paradoxical that this multiple crisis that has afflicted the world, including Europe, can also be a great ally, as those who have got used to telling everyone how to run their business bear the brunt of the responsibility for this crisis.
In order to ensure leadership, I also agree with the rapporteur, who suggests that the President of the Council be mandated to coordinate and oversee this process, in close cooperation with the President of the Commission, setting the spring session of the European Council as the time for the annual evaluation of the Single Market.
The present report establishes a set of actions that are aimed at promoting cooperation between the Member States in the field of transplantation in order to contribute to the increase in transplants, the reduction of waiting lists and a consequent reduction in the number of patients who die while waiting for an organ.
Mr President, the final declaration of the Durban II Review Conference, which Afghanistan is taking part in, concluded only today on the absolute need to make all forms of violence against women criminal offences punishable by law and on the condemnation of any judicial arsenal based on discrimination, including religious discrimination.
Now more than ever, the European Union needs to put into practice the old motto of solidarity proclaimed by the Musketeers: 'All for one and one for all' and provide financial aid to countries that have suffered, like Bulgaria, for vitally important projects which will provide it with energy security.
That is what we must do: we must call hatred for Jews anti-Semitism, hatred for Muslims Islamophobia, and hatred for Christians by the name it deserves, because that is the only way we will succeed in involving everyone in those countries who loves justice and freedom.
We therefore fully endorse the Commission's thorough approach to preparing candidates for membership and its willingness to learn the lessons of previous enlargements, in particular, the most recent ones to Bulgaria and Romania, where there were outstanding problems in the areas of organised crime and corruption.
It is therefore time to revive, if we are ever going to do so, the relations established by the European Union with the African countries at our borders, starting with Tunisia, by fully enhancing the potential of this area and maintaining its associated social and economic development, but within a framework of freedom and security.
Yet the Italian left, rather than adopting its own political strategy, is relying on elements of the national federation of journalists to exhibit the most disloyal and obstinate anti-democratic assault on the government in office - through a series of orchestrated actions on this occasion.
In the end, in a country like Portugal - which has always been at the forefront of human rights with the abolition of slavery in Portugal as soon as 1761 and which was a pioneer in abolishing the death penalty - we could clearly only be interested in supporting this accession process.
the report by Mr Masip Hidalgo, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers (recast) - C6-0477/2008 -,
Mr President, it is clear to us and to Europe, to the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and to us in Europe, that energy has become a foreign policy tool, an element of change that is capable of sparking conflicts or uniting us, and this is precisely the subject that concerns us today.
European vessels entitled to fish in Seychelles' waters will take on board observers appointed by the Seychelles authorities, and during a trip each tuna seiner will take on board at least two Seychelles seamen, in agreement with the shipowner, from the names on a list submitted by the competent authority of Seychelles.
Mr President, I am surprised that the Commissioner seems so optimistic about getting the situation in Fukushima under control in a few days when nuclear experts have talked about weeks and months; meanwhile the plant is still emitting radiation which is continuing to seep into the food supply and into the water supply.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Šefčovič, ladies and gentlemen, I can only welcome the fact that the European Parliament is taking a serious-minded and practical approach to the issue of the democratisation of European decision-making processes.
I voted for the resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for supporting the persons made redundant from the family firm Linak A/S, located in Sønderborg, Denmark.
For the rest, ladies and gentlemen, last March, when adopting a resolution on rising prices in the EU and in developing countries, we in this House stated that the right to a sufficient and varied diet suitable for a healthy and active lifestyle is a fundamental right to be permanently guaranteed to all.
I voted in favour of drawing up a development strategy for the Danube, which will allow us to ask the Commission to draft this document as soon as possible, taking into account specific consultations with experts in the field and in the relevant regions, while identifying the financial resources available and including non-EU countries.
I voted for this report because in Romania as well as in other Member States we are sometimes faced with crises which affect public and animal health safety in relation to animal products, such as transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, dioxin, swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease.
It is therefore natural that, if a group of European Union states decided to create a single common currency, it must find a mechanism for preventing populist politicians from burdening the common currency with unsustainable liabilities - debts that are used to purchase the support of voters in the short term.
We have made this topic subject to a discussion in a morning session in New York where we invited NGOs, Haitian as well as international NGOs, and I was very proud that it was the European NGOs that put these issues of agricultural security for Haiti and high agricultural return in productivity for the discussion in Haiti.
There are many other elements to consider, but it is certain that this will be an important time to battle against the destruction of our trees, that this focus fits in very well with the biodiversity strategy and that this will be, without a doubt, one of the key elements of action taken by the European Union this year.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I offer a warm welcome to the Czech Presidency and I hope that it will succeed in moving Europe on from the useless persiflage of Brussels to action on combating the disgraceful human trafficking of illegal migrants taking place in the Mediterranean.
I would like to pay particular attention to the emphasis she rightly places, in her report, on consumer education, which is essential and which must continue throughout life, since it is not only a matter for young children but also for consumers, given the extent to which products change and marketing forces become more sophisticated.
the report by Petya Stavreva on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) - C6-0051/2009 -,
The Commission has announced that it will take the necessary action once its officials have analysed the Lithuanian legislation, and my question is: has the analysis been carried out yet and have your officials, as part of that analysis, considered what the consequences could be for the recognition of same-sex couples from other Member States?
The fourth matter is the problem of protecting children from paedophiles and kidnappers, and also the opportunity to track down criminals using traces they have left on the Internet, such as a paedophile's address, or recordings of crimes made using mobile telephones and then posted on the Internet.
I appreciate your firm commitment to the Community method, starting with the speeches by Mr Daul, Mr Schulz, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Cohn-Bendit, although I cannot stretch to such oratory elegance as the 'Deauville deal' or the 'casino compromise'.
Mr President, it is very clear that the Europe we wish to establish as a 'power' will not be able to shore itself up against the United States, but instead alongside the United States, as two partners who share a certain vision of the world, some values, and have a mutual respect for each other.
I believe this partnership would be not only an opportunity but a necessity as well because, if what we have been saying is true, which is that Europe's integrated approach is its main potential, achieving that integrated approach will require the support of a body endowed with clear legislative and budgetary powers.
Some steps forward have been made in the last few years at European level, especially through a 2009 directive, but there is still much to do, especially to guarantee full civil rights to sufferers from this condition in the world of work and of mobility, and in guaranteeing the availability of medication during school hours.
I voted in favour of the '2010 progress report on Iceland' as I believe that we need to support the accession of one of the oldest European democracies to the EU, provided that the necessary requirements are met, such as the abolition of whaling and the trading of products extracted from whales.
As far as supervision is concerned, Mr Audy has gone over this, he knows our position; we are completely open, we are already supervised to a large extent by an independent audit committee, by the European Court of Auditors, when we use the European budget, by OLAF and by the European Ombudsman.
I agree that it is necessary to assess the functioning of national systems at European level, so that it is possible to clarify matters as regards the protection of children's rights, and take measures, if necessary, that would ensure more effective protection of homeless children and give them opportunities to have a family and be safe.
in writing. - Mr Hegyi's own-initiative report emphasises the importance of the protection of wilderness areas in Europe in the application of existing Directives, proposing a definition of 'wilderness' as still untouched areas as well as 'areas where human activities are minimal'.
(DE) Madam President, as a fervent pro-European, I was against the Treaty of Lisbon, precisely because it makes possible the kind of arguments that we have just heard, and precisely because it has not created the clarity and explicitness that I would want above all else for future generations.
What steps will the Commission take to achieve an agreement that recognises the common, but different, responsibilities that industrialised countries and developing countries share, based on historical input of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and on the resources available to deal with the challenges involved in reducing emissions and the consequences of climate change?
The current regulations expire in 2011, meaning that it is necessary for us to start making immediate efforts towards working on a new instrument which could maintain and, if possible, even further increase the benefits which this system has been providing to developing states, something which is even more important within the context of leaving the international crisis behind us.
There has been progress on some of the conflicts we have there and, as rapporteur for Kosovo, I am very pleased that the Spanish Presidency has announced during its presidency that it will invite Kosovo to take part in the western Balkans conference, which I hope will be an opportunity for progress on the status issue.
(DE) Madam President, just 14 days ago, the Japanese company Toshiba and others that built nuclear power stations wrote in their promotional brochures that they had the safest nuclear power stations in the world - so much for the claim that we in Europe definitely have the safest atomic energy plants.
I have to say that this directive, as it has been submitted to the Commission, is one which came into being organically, out of a profound debate in Parliament and countless debates at Commission level and therefore it is a directive which is well thought-out and which expresses a firm and clear approach to values.
And today, when we recall that you too, Mr President, come from my country, a country which has suffered so much at the hands of totalitarianism, we know one thing - and this truly is the best thing about the EU - the European Union has ensured the nations of Europe 60 years without war.
Contrary to the EP, we do not consider it 'regrettable' that the United States is not represented in the UNHRC, firstly because of its constant breaches of human rights and international law and also because they did not present their candidature to avoid the shame of not being elected.
If Europe wishes to change the trend towards population reduction, we must, through the policy of the EU and the Member States, support families in all possible ways, and permit women and men to combine family life and work, but such that obligations connected with home and family are equally divided between men and women.
A similar process is now at work with Europol, which has gradually extended its remit to cover a whole series of crimes that are national in nature - but with the rather fascinating oversight that its personnel still have diplomatic immunity; in other words, they cannot be held to account for abuse of police powers.
The joint resolution between the European Union and Serbia, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, is mentioned, but at no time is it spelt out that this cannot be regarded as an official recognition of the independence of Kosovo by Serbia, or by those Member States of the Union that have not recognised it.
We are in our opening gambits, but in our group, we will be looking very clearly at the quality of expenditure - as the Commissioner has said, on expenditure where monies can be reasonably executed and not being in any way excessive in this regard because of the general situation we find ourselves in.
(FR) Mr President, first of all I would obviously like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Lyon, with whom I believe we all worked on the basis of mutual agreement to try to move forward, and I would like to say briefly, in just a few words, that the evidence is there for us to see.
This means that the need to move away from high levels of military spending, which are criticised in this report and which have risen in recent years, towards spending on social services, culture and the environment, which benefits the population, is a central element of this report and I am pleased that it has been included.
I am greatly pleased, Commissioner, to hear that the Commission, as well as Parliament and the Council, is determined to unblock the Cohesion Fund - the new proposal that has already been adopted by Parliament - so that new rules that are better adapted to the real needs of the public can be implemented.
Mr President, I think that you have a unique opportunity here to work with the President of the Commission - this also sends a clear signal to the Commission - to draw up a joint plan, a joint plan, Mr Barroso, for the future of our car factories, thereby steering them into the 21st century.
We know, of course, that all the support measures, particularly in the field of the Structural Funds, are implemented in close cooperation with the Member States, which is absolutely vital in order to guarantee the validity of the expenditure, but also generates substantial problems when it comes to control by the Commission.
For human reasons, I propose the introduction of everyone's right to reside in their native land, in their home country, and appropriate economic and other conditions should be created in the world, including in countries considered second-rate EU Member States, to ensure that people can live in the country that is their homeland.
I merely wish to draw the Commission's attention to the fact that it would be useful, before talking about compulsory fire insurance for every citizen, to talk about compulsory civil liability insurance for damage that may be caused to third parties, sometimes with malicious intent, but above all, through negligence.
I hope that the review of these two European policies will help, in the medium and long term, to balance the economic, financial and social situation in all Member States in order to prevent imbalances of the type which are being seen at the moment and are jeopardising the sustainable development of the European Union as a whole.
Since we have elections on 7 June and we currently have a huge influx of visitors, I would ask if we could look into whether, during the April and May sessions here in Strasbourg, we could have all rooms, including plenary, open to visitors until midnight, so that we can cater properly for all visitors.
This marks a new era, the era of negotiations between North and South on the issues that need to be resolved in order to implement the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement: citizenship, defining borders, deciding whether the Abyei region will be held by the North or South, sharing oil resources and debt matters.
Of course in our committee we want consumers to have access to cheap, affordable means, such as ADR, but I believe today's debate is first and foremost about identifying practical ways to give real help to our consumers and citizens, to ensure they get a fair deal, real redress and real remedies.
(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the political analysts and politicians - for example, Henry Kissinger - who predicted decades ago that besides the United States of America, the European Union, Russia and China, and India, too, would have a leading role in the new world order were right.
